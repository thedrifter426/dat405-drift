Description

in this project I try to combine all the things we have been learning so far;
variables, functions, loops, I experimented with many different event handlers
to see which one my work better and more user friendly.

For the code I created global and local variables for the new particles.
also in the function draw I created an array with some parameters to control
the new particles if the condition is meet.

in the mouse moved function I created some variables to move the particles
around and new particles to appair using the push syntax.
my canvas if the condition is meet.
in the particles variable I used the this. keyword to assign some
parameters like position and velocity for later use within the particles.

and lastly in the end we called the particles update, wallBound, and display
from the array we created early in the code and gave them
