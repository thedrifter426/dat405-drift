TOP 25 MOVIES - 2018

this is an application that allows you to navigate through a 25 top movies playlist
and on click of any video, that video will be display as the main video.
also on the small IMDb chart on the size, you can click and videos and their ratings
on the chart will display in a random order.
I created a playlist in my youtube channel, then i requested an apiKey to google.
there is a proccess to follow in order to get you apiKey, url, and playlist id.

refer to google developers for more information on getting your apiKey.

PREREQUISITES.

for this project I used different softwares.
-Atom ( you can installed for free)
-P5 libraries (free download)
-jquery libraries ( can be installed for free too)
-movie images
-youtube videos using API ( you can request you own apiKey to youtube)

GETTING STARTED.
we need two variables for the imges and names array.
let img[];
let names[]; // fill this array with your own list
this will help you to set up your canvas.
function setup() {
  createCanvas();
  imageMode();
  textAlign();
  textSize();

this is an example of the sintax to load your images from the array.
img[] = loadImages();

this will help you to style it a little bit with background and font size and color
function draw() {
  background();
  image();
  fill();
  text();
}

 I use jquery for the application.
 you will need to request your own apiKey to the website you want to use info from
$(document).ready(function () // will start jquery
let key= '';
let playListId = '';
let URL = '';

will load you videos from the playlist using some parametres
loadvids();
function loadVids() {
    $.getJSON(URL, options, function (data) {
        let id = data.items[0].snippet.resourceId.videoId;
        mainVid(id);
        resultsLoop(data);
    });
}
here you can paste the link for you iframe link
function mainVid(id) {
    $('#video').html(`  `);
}
 this will help you to loop through the playlist using the parameter provided by youtube
function resultsLoop(data) {
    $.each(data.items, function (i, item) {

        let thumb =
        let title =
        let desc =
        let vid =

        $('main').append(`
          <article class="item" data-key="${vid}">
            <img src="${thumb}" alt="" class="thumb">
            <div class="details">
              <h4>${title}</h4>
              <p>${desc}</p>
            </div>
          </article>
        `);
    });
}
// on click on any video on the playlist, this video will be display as the main vid.
$('main').on('click', 'article', function () {
    let id = $(this).attr('data-key');
    mainVid(id);
});
});



this application and movies chart will work well using chrome.
the information display is static and only can be alter by the owner of the youtube channel.
